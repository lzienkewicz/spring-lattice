Hello all! Thank you for checking out this small physics project! This was project my friend and I (James Kaye, Physics @ Carnegie Mellon University '28) did for our first semester 'Matter and Interactions - 33151' class. The report for this project can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQqlTD0O43ctZaCPcfIoHuJi2Um2mfSC-70UlUGCVpov_NDzG-vWwBGW_Kw3BajVuxtKFz5CNPNqT9A/pub). This is an open source project, feel free to use it. All inoputs are in SI units and the project should be ran in a JupyterNotebook environment that contains vPython.
